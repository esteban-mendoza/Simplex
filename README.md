# The Simplex Algorithm
This repository contains a GUI for the Simplex algorithm implemented in `MATLAB` R2020a to solve the linear programming problem in its first primal form. The implementation is based on the pseudocode of Ward Cheney and David Kincaid, on their _Numerical Mathematics and Computing_, 6th edition, page 673.

# Binaries for Windows
If you want to run this GUI, you may want to use the provided binaries.  
- Version 9.8 (R2020a) of the MATLAB Runtime is required.
- If you don't have the MATLb Runtime installed in your computer, go to `Binaires/for_redistribution`, download and install `MyAppInstaller_web.exe`.
